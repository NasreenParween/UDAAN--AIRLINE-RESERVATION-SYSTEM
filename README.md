## project overview:-

The entire component has been developed using Java technology. Java has been chosen as the platform because of its feature-rich nature. 
In this **'Airline Reservation System Project'** we have two user- **1)Customer  2)The Administrator**.

In **Customer Window** Customer is able to login , check his/her all BookingDetails,PaymentDetails,CancellationDetails,All Flights ,able to register his/her query and can also see the answer of the queries and notifications"

In the **administrative part** Anyone from admin department login and can change all the Flight information, can see all custromer ,all customer payments,cancellation, booking and query and can answer these queries as well and can also add the notification have to show on this window.


### Though the project already exist, but we have added some new and advantageous features. Below you can find out our features-

**1)** We have separated the customer UI and the management UI so that any random user cannot modify the flight details or any other details.

**2)** We have added the page for asking query and another page in the Management Department to answer all the Queries.

**3)** Feature of adding notifications shown on the user window.

**4)** Sending Confirmation mail after booking.

**5)** We have represented the flight seats in the form of a button so that user can select the desired seat. If the seat is already booked it turns red and we have to choose another seat.

### I have added my code, images used and some screenshots of my project in this repository refer this.
